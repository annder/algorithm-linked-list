# Algorithm: Linked List

This is a Codewars series. Linked list is a data structure to practise recursion, and this series contains many basic operations of linked lists.

Note: some katas need TCO(tail call optimization) to test large linked lists. TCO is only enabled on Node.js 6.2.0+ with strict mode and `--harmony` flag. I setup them in the `mocha.opts`.
